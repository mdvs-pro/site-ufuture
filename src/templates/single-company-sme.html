          <blockquote>
            <p>“Entrepreneurs are proactive citizens, they create jobs, increase competitiveness of municipalities and Ukraine at whole. In this connection it is crucially important to develop the local business environment within particular municipalities. Usually entrepreneurs require systematic knowledge to develop their own businesses, increase volumes of sales but they are lack of time to get education. We are glad that our initiative of intensive business education received a significant interest from the side of tutors, experts that wish to assist the beginners to avoid needless mistakes.”</p>
