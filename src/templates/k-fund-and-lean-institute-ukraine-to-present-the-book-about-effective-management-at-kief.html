                <p class="post__text">The Work of Management: A Daily Path to Sustainable Improvement by Jim Lancaster was published in the Ukrainian language under the title «Лідерство в стилі LEAN: шлях до постійного вдосконалення вашого бізнесу».</p>
                <p>Kyiv, 04 October 2017. — Vasyl Khmelnytsky’s fund – K.Fund – together with Lean Institute Ukraine published Jim Lancaster’s book The Work of Management: A Daily Path to Sustainable Improvement in the Ukrainian language. The presentation of the book will be held at Kyiv International Economic Forum with the participation of Serhii Komberianov, the president of Lean Institute Ukraine and science editor of the Ukrainian edition.</p>
                <p>Jim Lancaster is the CEO of Lantech, the machine manufacturing company, which was one of the lean (the management concept based on minimization of all kind of waste) leaders in the 1990s. His book will be of service to those who have been implementing lean practices for long, as well as to those who have only set sights on the improvement of their businesses and are ready to study the art of lean.</p>
                <blockquote>“This is the story I have been waiting for. Jim generously shares his experience of mistakes which are, believe me, common for most of Ukrainian top managers. The book clearly shows how to proceed from the management a la putting out a fire to creating conditions for fires to never appear. I recommend the book to business owners, CEOs, divisional managers and to everybody who is looking for clear guidance in management of volatile processes, as well as those willing to bring up self-acting and initiative workers,” noted Serhii Komberianov, the president of Lean Institute Ukraine.</blockquote>
                <p>The Work of Management is a close-up, candid story of the leader, who succeeded to take his company to a new level of development, to achieve the never-before-seen profitability and to provide it with leadership positions at its market. To replicate his success, one only needs eight steps. They will help to create a bullet-proof, real-time daily management system. Jim Lancaster describes these steps in detail and instantiates them with the experience of his company.</p>
                <blockquote>“In plain language and illustrations, Jim shows a management system you can apply to your organization with dramatic results… I think you will find it inspiring and fun too”, <cite>– wrote Jim Womack, Founder and Senior Advisor of Lean Enterprise Institute, USA, in the book foreword.</cite></blockquote>
